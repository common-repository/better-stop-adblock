With or without adblocker or with Javascript enabled or disabled. We simply access only to the file that is already in the cache of the browser itself.* 2) What if the visitor has Javascript disabled?* Visitors will receive a message to enable javascript in order to access the page.* 3) With the script are excluded from the search engines?* No. A crawler search engine does not execute HTML code, as it makes your browser, but simply just read the source code of the page. After the source code is filtered to certain elements (text, images, links, etc..). Ie no javascript or css, everything else is executed. Google can take screenshots from web pages, which lead from the source. However, Google does not use any adblocker, then no message.= What about? =Do not be scoragiare by thoughts such as loss of visits and visitors loss.The equation that you have to think is a: without visitors no gain but with so many visitors without the banner is the same thing.So it's up to us to educate visitors to behave in a more correct, because many services that benefit them for free and they are only required a quick loading of a banner.= Comments or Requests in all languages =[COMMENTS](http://codeclan.altervista.org/better-stop-adblock-25)== Screenshots ==1. alert text2. alert image3. alert javascript4. settings== Changelog === Version 2.1 =* Improved code translation* Fixed css= Version 2.0 =* Added ability to insert all the pages you want to exclude or enable the plugin* Fixed minor bugs= Version 1.9.2 =* Fixed bugs ( conflict with new wordpress )* Fixed css= Version 1.9.1 =* Fixed bad code= Version 1.9.0 =* Add setting for easy color picker background and text color* Fixed bugs* Added new languages= Version 1.8 =* Add setting for DOCTYPE declaration* Update new banner= Version 1.7.1 =* Fixed bugs bad code banner= Version 1.7 =* Added ability to alert with custom audio file* Updated list banner ads* Fixed bugs Countdown to the release unlocking button= Version 1.6 =* Fixed bugs css with z-index* Added Languages ES, FR, DE= Version 1.5 =* Fixed bugs session time* Removed deprecated code* Fixed Default Settings= Version 1.4 =* New Options* Disable/Enable Plugin or a Custom Page* Disable/Enable a Session Contdown before to take action= Version 1.3 =* Fixed bugs css* W3c validation= Version 1.2 =* Fixed bugs time with Firefox* New option for setting time to take action= Version 1.1 =* Fixed bugs script* Fixed link redirect* Fixed time countdown= Version 1.0 === Upgrade notice === Version 2.1 =* Improved code translation* Fixed css= Version 2.0 =* Added ability to insert all the pages you want to exclude or enable the plugin* Fixed minor bugs= Version 1.9.2 =* Fixed bugs ( conflict with new wordpress )* Fixed css= Version 1.9.1 =* Fixed bad code= Version 1.9.0 =* Add setting for easy color picker background and text color* Fixed bugs* Added new languages= Version 1.8 =* Add setting for DOCTYPE declaration* Update new banner= Version 1.7.1 =* Fixed bugs bad code banner= Version 1.7 =* Added ability to alert with custom audio file* Updated list banner ads* Fixed bugs Countdown to the release unlocking button= Version 1.6 =* Fixed bugs css with z-index* Added Languages ES, FR, DE= Version 1.5 =* Fixed bugs session time* Removed deprecated code* Fixed Default Settings= Version 1.4 =* New Options* Disable/Enable Plugin in global site or a Custom Page* Disable/Enable a Session Contdown before to take action= Version 1.3 =* Fixed bugs css* W3c validate= Version 1.2 =* Fixed bugs time with Firefox* New option for setting time to take action= Version 1.1 =* Fixed bugs script* Fixed link redirect* Fixed time countdown
